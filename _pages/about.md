Hi, welcome to my webpage!

## About me

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Insubria](https://www.phd.eco.uninsubria.it/methods-and-models-for-economic-decisions/phd-students/), currently working as a Visiting Scholar at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en). My research interests are in **applied econometrics** and **machine learning**, primarily focusing on sustainability, innovation, and development economics, with a secondary interest in gender inequality.

Prior to my current visit, I was a Visiting Researcher for six months at the [University of Jena's](https://www.jsec.uni-jena.de/en) Schumpeter Center for Research on Socio-Economic Change.

I am currently on the 2025-2026 Economics Job Market.
