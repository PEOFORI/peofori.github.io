**Hi, welcome to my webpage!**

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Insubria](https://www.uninsubria.eu/). During the 2024–2025 academic year, I was a visiting researcher at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en) and the [Schumpeter Center for Research on Socio-Economic Change](https://www.jsec.uni-jena.de/en) at the University of Jena, respectively.

I hold a double Master of Science in Global Entrepreneurship, Economics and Management, and Innovation and Change, awarded jointly by the [University of Insubria](https://www.uninsubria.eu/) and the [University of Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en). I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics with Economics at the [University of Cape Coast](https://ucc.edu.gh/) in 2018.

My research interest lies at the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Applied Econometrics** with a primary focus on Environmental Economics, Innovation, and Development Economics, with a secondary interest in **Gender Studies**.
