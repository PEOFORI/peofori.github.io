Hi, welcome to my home page!

## About me

I am currently a Visiting Scholar at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en), Department of Economic Theory and Economic History and spent a 6 months at Schumpeter Center for Research on Socio-Economic Change, [University of Jena](https://www.jsec.uni-jena.de/en) as a visiting researcher.

I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Economics, [University of Insubria](https://www.phd.eco.uninsubria.it/methods-and-models-for-economic-decisions/phd-students/). My research interests are within the field of **applied econometrics** and **machine learning** with a specialization in sustainability, innovation and development economics. I dabble sometimes in issues of gender inequality.
