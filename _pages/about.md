**Hi, welcome to my webpage!**

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Insubria](https://www.uninsubria.eu/). During the 2024–2025 academic year, I was a visiting researcher at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en) and the [Schumpeter Center for Research on Socio-Economic Change](https://www.jsec.uni-jena.de/en) at the University of Jena, respectively.

My research interests lie at the intersection of innovation, environmental and development economics with a secondary interest in Gender Studies. I study how technological innovation, green growth, and green finance affect environmental sustainability. I combine causal inference, machine learning, instrumental variable models to study the determinants of environmental sustainability.



**I am currently on the 2025–2026 Economics Job Market.**
