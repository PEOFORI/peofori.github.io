Hi, welcome to my webpage!

## About me

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Insubria](https://www.phd.eco.uninsubria.it/methods-and-models-for-economic-decisions/phd-students/). My research interests lies at the intersection of **Applied Econometrics** and **Machine Learning** with a primarily focus on Environmental Economics, Innovation, and Development Economics, and a secondary interest in Gender Studies.

During my studies, I have also been a Visiting Researcher at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en) and the [University of Jena's](https://www.jsec.uni-jena.de/en) Schumpeter Center for Research on Socio-Economic Change.

I am currently on the 2025-2026 Economics Job Market.
